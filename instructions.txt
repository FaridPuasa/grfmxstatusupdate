For nodejs project, create a page where the purpose is to create a runsheet based on multiple inputs:

1) Required dropdown selection field named "POD created by". The selection available are:

6) Required text area named "Tracking Number(s)" that accepts multiple tracking number line by line, remove space by trim

Submit button that disabled when clicked, with a loading animation.

After submission, a function will be run where the API will be run for each tracking number

    const trackingNumbers = req.body.trackingNumbers.trim().split('\n').map((id) => id.trim());

    for (const trackingNumber of trackingNumbers) {
        try {

            // Skip empty lines
            if (!trackingNumber) continue;

            // Step 2: Make the first API GET request to fetch data from Detrack
            const response1 = await axios.get(`https://app.detrack.com/api/v2/dn/jobs/show/?do_number=${trackingNumber}`, {
                headers: {
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                    'X-API-KEY': apiKey
                }
            });

            const data = response1.data;

The data fields that is retrieved from the API through each tracking number are as follows:

data.data.deliver_to_collect_from
data.data.address
data.data.phone_number
data.data.job_type (if there is no data for this or null, leave it empty)
data.data.total_price
data.data.payment_mode (if there is no data for this or null, leave it empty)
